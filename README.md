# Deep-Learning-with-LandCover-Dataset
This project  is about deep learning applications on land cover and usage dataset. The model we have applied are transfer learning with fine-tuning of VGG19 model, the convolutional neural network we have built and multi layer perceptron models. The results are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and confusion matrix
